    <h2>How it started:</h2>
      <p>In 2021 i started a project that i make things with html and javascript</p>
      <p>this grew to make making a free notepad website (you can see here) that</p>
      <p>would just have a simple textarea and some setings that you could change.</p>
      <p>Then i started making a Online Tools website that had lots of tools on it</p>
      <p>that you can use for free. This included notepad, calander and many others</p> 
      <p>Then i found a old router and i wanted to make a guest network that wehn you</p>
      <p>joined you would get met with a internet login page that you could login</p>
      <p>so you could get internet, i made this with PHP and html! Now i made a games/proxy</p>
      <p>website that you could use for free, Now we are here. Thanks for the journey!</p>
